# Installation

Copy the blueforest.xml into the Styles-Directory of your Qt Creator installation.

## OSX

You can install the theme using the following commands on a Terminal:

    cd ~/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/styles
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lichtzeichner/blueforest-theme/master/qtcreator/blueforest.xml

## Windows

The path for installing on windows is (create the styles folder, if it doesn't exist):

    %AppData%\QtProject\qtcreator\styles

Download the blueforest.xml file and place it in that directory.
